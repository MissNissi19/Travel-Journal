Travel Journal 

Travel Journal is a solo project built using JavaScript and React, showcasing three travel destinations. 
Although this project was developed as part of a course on the Scrimba platform, it was built independently based on a design from Figma. 
It is my first project in React.


Quick start:

```
$ npm install
$ npm run watch
$ open index.html
